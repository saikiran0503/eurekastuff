        // They inherit 'this' from the parent scope.
        // In this case, 'this' refers to the global object (window in browsers).
        // So, 'this' inside an arrow function is not the same as in a regular function.
        // It does not create its own 'this' context.
        // Instead, it uses the 'this' value from the surrounding lexical context.
        // This is why 'this' in an arrow function behaves differently than in a regular function
